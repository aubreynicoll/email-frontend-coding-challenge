# Email Frontend
![](https://i.imgur.com/WlAPVCO.png)

## Motivation
This email frontend was part of a coding challenge. \
Given a spec sheet, a mockup of a design, and some icons, I was asked to create a finished product.

## Technologies Used

* React
* React Router
* SASS
* Regular Expressions (for date filtering)
* Prop Types

## Features
This app is built around the idea of being able to audit email history. As a result, it has read-only functionality; however, it does allow for filtering by date, and sorting by parameter.
